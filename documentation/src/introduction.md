Flipper is an embedded development platform designed from the ground up to provide seamless abstraction between the application layer and common hardware peripherals such as GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, and more. In other words, Flipper makes it easy to control simple hardware from any programming language on any platform in real-time.
