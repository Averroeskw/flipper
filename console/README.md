# Flipper Console

### Overview

The Flipper Console is a command line utility that provides a means for out of the box interaction with Flipper hardware. The console serves as an interpreter for a basic grammar that describes interaction with Flipper standard modules. The console can also dynamically load user generated modules and understand the grammer used to interact with user APIs. A basic scripting language is also provided that enables the automated execution of console commands with basic control flow.
