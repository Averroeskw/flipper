Flipper
===

### Simple hardware, any language, any platform.

Our Goal
===

The goal of this project is to create a well-defined standard that introduces a new way of interacting with embedded hardware at runtime. **Flipper is an embedded electronics prototyping platform that can be controlled from any programming language on any platform in real time.** By bringing the popular development paradigms of package management and build system integration to simple embedded hardware, Flipper provides a powerful platform and pain-free embedded development experience to *everyone*, regardless of skill set.

Visit [www.flipper.io](http://www.flipper.io/) to learn more about the project, as well as our first product. The official documentation for the Flipper platform can be found at [docs.flipper.io](http://docs.flipper.io/).
