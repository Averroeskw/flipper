# Flipper Toolbox

### Overview

Flipper is an embedded development platform designed from the ground up to
provide seamless abstraction between the application layer and common hardware
peripherals such as GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, and more. In other words, Flipper makes it easy to control **simple hardware** from **any programming language** on **any platform** in **real-time**.

This "Flipper Toolbox" is a repository of complimentary sofware components designed to work together to enable control Flipper hardware from a wide variety of host platforms and programming environments. This repository is organized into a variety of submodules pertainent to the differing layers of abstraction mentioned above. More on each of these submodules can be found within the `README` of the submodule.
