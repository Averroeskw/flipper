# Toolbox

### Overview

**The Flipper "Toolbox" is a repository of sofware components designed to work together to provide effortless control of Flipper hardware from a wide variety of host platforms and programming environments.**

A lightweight control stack known as the Flipper Message Runtime lies at the heart of the toolbox and fascilitates real time interaction with Flipper hardware. The message runtime allows collections of applications, functions, routines, and variables to be modified, invoked, or replaced during runtime. FMR also enables the seamless transmission of data between separate address spaces with no overhead to user programs.

This repository is organized into a variety of subfolders that contain the source for discreet components pertainent to the Flipper project as a whole. The roles of these components are described below.
